# Custom Music Player for COS10009

## Overview

### All requirements met

- Album details view with song list and play functionality for individual tracks
- Pages for albums with pagination
- Album and track classes for better organization.
- Dynamic album grid layout with thumbnails.
- Gosu graphics for rendering the GUI

### Additional Features

- Tab system to switch between albums, genres, and playlist.
- Context menu for album actions (add all songs to playlist, reveal in explorer, delete).
- Playlist functionality to add songs, play, shuffle, and clear.
- Genres tab remembers what was clicked upon navigating away.

### Issues

- The way I generated albums.txt, it scanned album folders alphabetically, so track order isn't the same as within the original albums.
- When playing a song from the playlist, and then clicking shuffle, the original song's position will be removed from the playlist when the song completes. This can be mitigated by checking the NAME of the song instead of the index, but I ran out of time :(
- There's nothing stopping you from adding far too many songs in an album (and hence playlist). Although the requirement says 15, adding more than 20 will cause GUI overflow.
- (Fixed) If the user plays a song, then adds one to the playlist, when the playing song is complete, the playlist will be cleared since the logic thinks the playlist finished playing all its songs.

## Running the Application

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system.
2. Install the required gems by running:

   ```bash
   gem install gosu
   ```

3. Clone the repository or download the source code.
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
5. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   ruby player.rb
   ```

6. The application will start, and you can interact with the music player GUI.

## Structure

The `albums.txt` file is generated by the `generate.py` script. It scans the `sounds` directory for subdirectories and creates an entry for each album. Do not modify this file manually, as it will be overwritten when you run the script again.

The `sounds` directory contains the audio files for the albums. Ensure that the audio files are in a compatible format (e.g., MP3) for playback.

The `media` folder contains all the media files used in the application, including album covers and icons. A small script called `extract.py` is provided to extract the album art from an MP3 file.

All Python scripts are not required to run the application but are provided for convenience in managing the albums and media files.

The program is entirely dependent on `albums.txt` for its functionality, so ensure this file is present and correctly formatted.
